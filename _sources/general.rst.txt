Graduate School Offices
--------------------------------------

The main office of the Graduate School is on the fourth floor of the
Granada Center on the Lake Shore Campus.
This office handles admissions and financial awards,
and houses the permanent files of all students throughout their graduate careers.

We strongly recommend that you contact the department faculty and
staff first unless your matter absolutely requires direct Graduate School assistance.
Going to the Graduate School first is more likely to slow things down for you than speed them up.

Graduate Program Director
--------------------------

Regardless of the MS program in which you're enrolled,
your first adviser will be your Graduate Program Director (abbreviated **GPD**),
gpd@cs.luc.edu.
The current director for Software Engineering and Computer Science is Dr. Andrew N. Harrington.
The current director for Information Technology is Dr. Channah Naiman.
You are expected to confer with your GPD about your initial course of study
in pursuit of your degree. You should be assigned an advisor for later semesters,
to consult about the progression of your academic program.
The GPDs are also available for further discussion of
your progress in the program and your future plans.

    Committee on Graduate Programs
    --------------------------------------

    The Director is advised on all matters of policy, admissions,
    and student status by the Committee on Graduate Programs.

.. index:: ID cards

Student ID Cards
--------------------------------------

After registering for classes, Student ID cards, which give access to library borrowing and other privileges,
are available from Corboy Law Center, 25E. Pearson or the Campus Card Office, Sullivan Center, Room 117.
See http://www.luc.edu/campuscard/ for more information.

.. index:: computer services

Computer Services
--------------------------------------

The University maintains several Computer Centers which are available
for your use in Sullivan Center, Information Commons, and at 25 E. Pearson.

All university students are responsible for reading and following
http://www.luc.edu/its/itspoliciesguidelines/policy_acceptableuse.shtml.

An account on the student email system is created automatically for each new student.
Both the GPD and the Graduate School will use this account
to communicate with you. It is therefore
*crucial that you check your Loyola e-mailbox on a regular basis.*
Having your e-mail forwarded to another account can be risky.
Some students find the mail doesn't always get delivered.
If you find that you are not receiving regular and frequent communiqués from the
Department, please notify the Secretary.

Students are encouraged to consult the Systems Handbook for more information about
departmental and university computing resources. See http://syshandbook.cs.luc.edu/.

.. index:: summer sessions

Summer Sessions
--------------------------------------

Summer sessions are offered through the Department each year,
running from May to August. There are two 6-week sessions and an
overlapping 8-week session.  Three to five graduate-level courses are generally
offered over these summer terms, plus:

* :ref:`independent_study` with a department faculty member is
  encouraged for research-minded students.  If you are starting in the summer,
  this does not generally make sense.
* :ref:`internships`.

   apartments

Housing
--------------------------------------

Most graduate students choose to find their own off-campus apartments
using the ads in the Reader, the Tribune, and other publicly available sources.
Loyola’s Department of Residence Life also offers single- and double-occupancy
apartments for graduate students on the Lakeshore Campus and the Water Tower Campus, though these fill rapidly.
For additional information, please see the links in
http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/gradstudcmty.shtml under Where To Live.

.. index:: transportation
   parking

Transportation
--------------------------------------

Parking is available near the Water Tower Campus, although it is rather expensive.
For sites listed in
http://www.luc.edu/campustransportation/generalinformation/watertowercampus/
you can have your parking stub stamped at the information desk
at the 25 E. Pearson building to receive a discount.
As a current student, you will also want to acquaint yourself with the
University’s inter-campus shuttle bus service.
Public buses and the “El” run frequently between campuses and to other
points in the city.

There is also parking available near the Lake Shore Campus.
The main parking structure is adjacent to Sheridan Road and to the Halas Sports Center.
The fee for one-day parking on campus is $7.00 or more.
At peak class times, available parking can sometimes be scarce.
Street parking in the community immediately surrounding campus is scarce.
It is also restricted to residents during certain hours,
so be sure to read the signs carefully to avoid being ticketed by the police.

Further information on parking and longer term parking permits is available at
http://www.luc.edu/parking/.
For information on the shuttle, see http://www.luc.edu/transportation/shuttlebus.shtml.

.. index:: publication

Publication
--------------------------------------

Research-oriented graduate students (especially those pursuing the
`Thesis Option <https://academics.cs.luc.edu/graduate/mscs.html#thesis-option>`_
in MS CS) are encouraged to pursue the publication of one or more journal articles
during their graduate career. In the current job market, publication is an
important means of demonstrating to prospective employers a high level of motivation
and professional competence.
It can also be helpful for your future pursuits as a doctoral student elsewhere.

Ways to prepare for this goal are 1) to read journals in your fields of interest
regularly in order to become familiar with both current scholarship
and the requirements of scholarly publication;
2) to approach seminar papers, especially those in your field(s) of interest,
as potential publications, possibly even as publications targeted to a particular journal.
In developing a paper for publication, students are of course well advised to work
closely with their seminar instructors or faculty mentors.

.. index:: conference presentations
   travel funding

Conference Presentations and Travel Funding
-----------------------------------------------

Presentation of conference papers is an important part of students’ professional
development, and MS CS students working on a thesis in particular should aim to give at
least two papers during their graduate careers — preferably including professional
and not just graduate-student conferences.

Each semester the Graduate School has funds to support graduate student
travel for the purpose of presenting papers or chairing sessions at conferences.
Since funds are limited, students should apply immediately upon acceptance of their
papers or sessions. Application is through http://gsps.luc.edu, under internal awards.

.. index:: Career Center
   jobs

Career Center
--------------------------------------

The University’s Career Center, where each student entering the job market
should establish a dossier containing letters of recommendation,
is located in Sullivan Center, Room 295 (773-508-7716),
with a very helpful website: http://www.luc.edu/career/RamberLink_Login.html

Students are encouraged to check our information jobs listings as well at
http://jobs.cs.luc.edu. We are routinely contacted by employers who are
seeking interns, consultants, and "permanent" employees.

.. index:: teaching opportunities

Teaching Opportunities
--------------------------------------

In addition to occasional teaching assignments for Graduate Assistants
(e.g. to help their instructor when he/she needs to be absent),
a number of teaching opportunities are available to experienced graduate students
and graduates who have gained experience since leaving our department
(with a preference for the latter). The University requires that you have the MS degree;
the Department requires that you have taken a wide range of challenging courses,
especially in foundational areas such as algorithms, languages, systems,
and software engineering with a solid record of achievement in all.

.. index:: awards

Department Awards
--------------------------------------

Each year the Department recognizes exceptional graduate students in all of
our degree programs. Awards are given for academics and service as described in
http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/awards/.

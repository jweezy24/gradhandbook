The current director for Information Technology is Dr. Channah Naiman.
You are expected to confer with your GPD about your initial course of study
in pursuit of your degree. You should be assigned an advisor for later semesters,
to consult about the progression of your academic program.
The GPDs are also available for further discussion of
your progress in the program and your future plans.</p>

Both the GPD and the Graduate School will use this account

Some students find the mail doesn’t always get delivered.

Loyola’s Department of Residence Life also offers single- and double-occupancy
apartments for graduate students on the Lakeshore Campus and the Water Tower Campus, though these fill rapidly.

For sites listed in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/campustransportation/generalinformation/watertowercampus/">http://www.luc.edu/campustransportation/generalinformation/watertowercampus/</a>
you can have your parking stub stamped at the information desk
at the 25 E. Pearson building to receive a discount.
As a current student, you will also want to acquaint yourself with the
University’s inter-campus shuttle bus service.
Public buses and the “El” run frequently between campuses and to other
points in the city.</p>
<p>There is also parking available near the Lake Shore Campus.
The main parking structure is adjacent to Sheridan Road and to the Halas Sports Center.
The fee for one-day parking on campus is $7.00 or more.
At peak class times, available parking can sometimes be scarce.
Street parking in the community immediately surrounding campus is scarce.
It is also restricted to residents during certain hours,
so be sure to read the signs carefully to avoid being ticketed by the police.</p>
<p>Further information on parking and longer term parking permits is available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/parking/">http://www.luc.edu/parking/</a>.

<div class="section" id="publication">
<span id="index-10"></span><h2>Publication<a class="headerlink" href="#publication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Research-oriented graduate students (especially those pursuing the
<a class="reference external" href="https://academics.cs.luc.edu/graduate/mscs.html#thesis-option">Thesis Option</a>
in MS CS) are encouraged to pursue the publication of one or more journal articles
during their graduate career. In the current job market, publication is an
important means of demonstrating to prospective employers a high level of motivation
and professional competence.
It can also be helpful for your future pursuits as a doctoral student elsewhere.</p>
<p>Ways to prepare for this goal are 1) to read journals in your fields of interest
regularly in order to become familiar with both current scholarship
and the requirements of scholarly publication;
2) to approach seminar papers, especially those in your field(s) of interest,
as potential publications, possibly even as publications targeted to a particular journal.
In developing a paper for publication, students are of course well advised to work
closely with their seminar instructors or faculty mentors.</p>

<span id="index-11"></span><h2>Conference Presentations and Travel Funding<a class="headerlink" href="#conference-presentations-and-travel-funding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Presentation of conference papers is an important part of students’ professional
development, and MS CS students working on a thesis in particular should aim to give at
least two papers during their graduate careers — preferably including professional
and not just graduate-student conferences.</p>
<p>Each semester the Graduate School has funds to support graduate student
travel for the purpose of presenting papers or chairing sessions at conferences.
Since funds are limited, students should apply immediately upon acceptance of their
papers or sessions. Application is through <a class="reference external" href="http://gsps.luc.edu">http://gsps.luc.edu</a>, under internal awards.</p>

(e.g. to help their instructor when he/she needs to be absent),
a number of teaching opportunities are available to experienced graduate students
and graduates who have gained experience since leaving our department
(with a preference for the latter). The University requires that you have the MS degree;
the Department requires that you have taken a wide range of challenging courses,
especially in foundational areas such as algorithms, languages, systems,

<h2>Overview of Loyola MS Programs’ Strengths<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-loyola-ms-programs-strengths" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Committed faculty teaching small classes, commonly 15-25 students</li>
<li>Many project based classes with big concepts for all, which students
get to develop in their own way in their individual projects,
with active individual support from the instructor</li>
<li>Flexibility and breadth: About ½ of each program is electives
which can vary from business-centric, data-centric,
networking and security, software engineering,
to core computer science.
Many students come in not knowing exactly what they are most interested in.
Students can sample different areas,
choose to change the degree program in the middle,
and still have all their courses count toward the final degree.</li>
<li>Enroll part-time or full-time, and back and forth, as you choose</li>
<li>Strong advising/support throughout:
as students inquire about the program, apply, plan initial courses,
and as experience evolves</li>
<li>Lots of data on and opportunities for internships and jobs:
Internships can count in the academic program.
High regard of our program in industry smooths job transition.</li>
<li>Strong encouragement toward independent study with
individual professors in a wide variety of areas</li>
<li>Finish full-time in 16 months;
less if you can get two courses of transfer credit</li>
<li>Opportunity for discipline changers to be accepted and take
prerequisites with us on a compressed schedule</li>
<li>Options for a mix of face-to-face and online classes.
<em>Now the IT degree is available either campus-centric or entirely online</em>.</li>
<li>International students with insufficient English can get conditional admission
combining initial ESL with later MS study.</li>
<li>Starting in Fall 2019 you can build up to an MS by doing graduate certificates.</li>

<p id="index-1"><strong>No application deadline for plain admission</strong>:
Applications are continuously evaluated and students
will be promptly admitted to the nearest starting term or semester.
Earlier admission means that you get to register online for classes earlier,
and some classes may fill up.  In particular, registration for fall starts in April,
for spring in late October, and for summer in February.
It is to your advantage to be admitted before those times for the earliest
access to advising and registration.</p>
<p>While <em>regular</em> admission does not have a deadline,
see <a class="reference internal" href="assistantships.html#new-student-merit"><span class="std std-ref">New Student Assistantships</span></a>, for
<em>application deadlines to be considered for such an award</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
Please note that you can apply and be accepted without
having all the undergraduate prerequisites listed for degree programs.
See the section of the course document on
<a class="reference external" href="https://academics.cs.luc.edu/graduate/masters_prereqs.html">prerequisites</a>.</p>

<p>For navigating the application, note that the programs are in the
<strong>School of Arts and Sciences</strong>, and all are offered by the Computer Science department,

prefixed by “Computer Science:”</p>
<p>This form is used for many programs in the graduate school, and
not all graduate programs are available to students in all locations:</p>
<div class="admonition warning">

</li>
<li><p class="first">Submit official English transcripts of all undergraduate work and any
post-baccalaureate work either</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>by official electronic submission between your institution and Loyola or</li>
<li>still in sealed envelopes sent from the academic
institution. <em>Do not open such envelopes yourself.</em>  If you do not have
easy access to the sealed official documents, you can <em>initially</em> submit
copies for a <em>conditional</em> admission.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can send a transcript <em>in the semester before your graduation</em>,
showing all the courses you will be having for graduation,
even though grades are still missing from the final courses,
and still be eligible for conditional admission.
Do <em>not send transcripts too early</em> to show a
listing of all the courses you will end up taking for your degree.
In all cases final officially-sent transcripts are required by the end of your first semster at Loyola.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">GRE scores are not required for admission.
If you choose to submit them, Loyola’s institutional code is 1412;
the department code is not needed.
GRE scores, however, are expected if you are applying for a merit award
( <a class="reference internal" href="assistantships.html#teaching-assistantships"><span class="std std-ref">Teaching Assistantships</span></a> ),
and if you are not already a Loyola student.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">One letter of recommendation is required, though
three are recommended.
These are usually from referees familiar with your academic work,
however, if you have been out of school for a long time,
then letters of recommendation from work supervisors
will be acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An informal Statement of Purpose document is highly recommended,
though not required: something about where you are coming from
and where you look to go.  This extra information helps with
initial advising for you, and occasionally the narrative will clear up
some question about the application.</p>

<span id="index-4"></span><span id="id2"></span><h3>Additional Requirements for International Applicants<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-requirements-for-international-applicants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Do not forget the <a class="reference internal" href="#requirements-for-all-applicants"><span class="std std-ref">Requirements for All Applicants</span></a>.  Here are
<em>additional</em> requirements and an option for international student admission
to the graduate degree programs in the
Department of Computer Science.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Students with transcripts issued by International universities or colleges
must be <em>evaluated</em> by an outside evaluator for GPA calculation and
determining if the degree is equivalent to an American Bachelor’s degree
(four-year degree or 3-year degree with an extra year of study after that):
Applicants may send international transcripts for a general evaluation
with <strong>Grade Average</strong> to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ece.org/">ECE</a>
for international evaluation and <em>allow 4-6 weeks</em>
for them to evaluate transcripts and get the results to Loyola.
<a class="reference external" href="http://edperspective.org/">Educational-Perspectives</a>
can also be used as an alternative to ECE.
<em>No other transcript evaluation service is accepted by Loyola.</em>
If you are in a rush, you can pay extra
for expedited service.  If you do <em>not yet have your undergraduate degree</em>, it is important that you send transcripts to the evaluator when all your final courses are shown, though some without grades.  This is
usually
<em>in your final semester</em>.  The evaluators can only determine the equivalence to a US 4-year degree if they see all the relevant courses listed on the transcript (again, possibly some without grades yet).  The conditional
admission requires the university to receive another official transcript, showing degree completion, though this
transcript can be sent to Loyola during your first semester here as a student.</p>
<p><strong>A suggested exception to getting the</strong> <em>general</em> <strong>transcript evaluation:</strong>
If you have international graduate level coursework after 4 years of
college level work, see <a class="reference internal" href="regulations.html#international-transfer"><span class="std std-ref">Further International Transcript Credit Transfer Requirements</span></a>.</p>
<p>Those students living abroad and seriously considering Loyola can write to the
Graduate Program Director at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">gpd<span>&#64;</span>cs<span>&#46;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> about waiving the
transcript evaluation fee. Be sure the <em>rest</em> of your application is
submitted when making this request, so it can be properly considered.
Official notification of a passing English test score must be included at that
time.
Requesting that Loyola handle the evaluation will require <em>extra time</em>,
since the transcript forms must be received first by Loyola
and sent off again to Educational Perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">International students
(with the exception of U.S. citizens or permanent residents)
must have their English tested <em>before</em> any kind of admission. There are different routes
depending on the results.</p>
<p>The Loyola Graduate School accepts just three approaches to the English
requirement, and a few explicit exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The usual way is to earn at least
79 on the Internet-based TOEFL test (or 550 on the old paper-based test)
or at least a 6.5 (overall band score) on the IELTS academic test.
The new 3-score paper TOEFL test requires at least
Reading: 21, Listening: 21 and
Writing: 23.
The <em>official results must come to Loyola directly</em>
<em>from the testing agency</em>.
Loyola’s institutional code is 1412;
the department code is not needed.</p>
<p>With lower scores, see the other options below.</p>
<p>Having your university courses officially offered in English does <em>not</em>
exempt you – though it should make passing the English exam easier.</p>
<p>You can <em>retake</em> an English exam as many times as you need
<em>before</em> admission to get up to a passing grade.</p>
<p>If taking one of these tests, be sure to sign up for an early test date,
since results usually take 2-3 weeks to be delivered <em>officially</em> to Loyola.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you have a TOEFL in the range 70-78 or IELTS of 5.5 or 6, then you may
be admitted conditionally to the new ICAP program:</p>
<p>You will be required to take an English Placement Test administered by our
English Language Learning Program (ELLP) to determine your placement in
ESL preparation courses. The results of that exam will determine the required ESL
courses you must take during your first term at Loyola.
You will take ESL classes until your English language skills are strong enough
for success in degree program courses. If you receive a final grade of at least a
B+ in all of your advanced or bridge ESL courses, you will be invited to take
an exit exam at the end of the term. A combination of your course-work and
exit exam score will be used to determine your readiness for degree work
in the following term. It is important to note that if testing indicates
further language study is needed, you will be required to continue in the
ELLP for another term. For more information about Loyola’s ELLP,
please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ELLP&#37;&#52;&#48;luc&#46;edu">ELLP<span>&#64;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>, or 773-508-3880.</p>
<p>We offer ICAP admission to students who have demonstrated their academic
abilities in the classroom, but may need additional English language
preparation and support to succeed in the degree program at Loyola University
Chicago. Students in this program are classified as full-time graduate students.</p>
<p>You can choose to bring up your English score to the level of regular admission
some other way and apply again later for regular admission.
However the ICAP program gives you conditional admission,
and allows you to be on campus for various Computer Science activities,
like seminars, hackathons, ….</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you have not had an English test or the result is too low for ICAP,
and you want to improve your English at Loyola, in preparation for
possible graduate study, you can <em>first</em>
apply to our full-time ESL program, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/esl/">http://www.luc.edu/esl/</a>,
and do well enough in courses and a comprehensive exam.  Only sufficient
achievement in <em>Loyola’s</em>
ESL program is a substitute for one of the standardized tests above.
Enrollment in an ESL program at another school is not a substitute
for the TOEFL or IELTS. With any other ESL program one of the
standardized tests is still required.</p>
<p>NOTE:  Loyola’s ESL is a separate program from the Graduate School.
If you were admitted directly to our ESL program, not to the Graduate School’s
ICAP program, then
appropriate certification from this ESL program merely
satisfies the English requirement for Graduate School applicants.
It does not imply the Graduate School Dean’s approval for your
admission.  All other
parts of your application remain to be considered (but see the note below).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The English requirement is <em>waived</em> only for students who satisfy
at least one of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>U.S. citizens and permanent residents.</li>
<li>Students with Bachelor’s or higher degree from accredited
institutions in the United States,
United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia or New Zealand,
who primarily attended their classes in those countries.
Students are exempt who
will complete one of these programs before matriculation at Loyola,
even if they have further degrees from another country.
Note: Graduating from a program offered in English from any <em>other</em> country
does <em>not</em> exempt the student from the English requirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If you do not yet have the necessary test results for one of the above
avenues, and your application is complete except
for the English requirement, then the Graduate Program Director (GPD)
is happy to look at your application and  <em>informally</em> let you know if you should expect the GPD’s
recommendation for admission, <em>after</em> obtaining a sufficient
official English score for one of the routes above.
Later, the Graduate School Dean’s approval is still needed for final admission.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">International applicants who will be on an F-1 visa
(including those who are seeking financial aid from the department)
are encouraged to submit proof (affidavit) of financial support to our
International students office <em>simultaneously</em> with filing their application.
The form should be linked on the page
<a class="reference external" href="http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml">http://luc.edu/iss/forms.shtml</a>
under something like the name,
Declaration of Finances for Graduate &amp; Professional Students.
This will help save a lot of time in processing the visa papers,
namely I-20 or IAP-66.
Students who are chosen for the merit awards or scholarships will be
notified regardless of their financial standing or ability to support
themselves financially.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>International students requiring an F-1 visa should consult the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/iss/outside.shtml">International Students and Scholars</a>
page for further information.</p>
<p>Though there is no admission deadline,
be sure to leave time to get the necessary official English test results and
transcript evaluations to Loyola before admission,
and allow time after admission for obtaining a visa.  If the process takes too
long, you can request to roll your admission over to the next semester.</p>

<span id="index-5"></span><span id="id3"></span><h2>Program Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#program-costs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Master’s program has a 10-course requirement
(once undergraduate prerequisites are satisfied).
The tuition fees for graduate students in the department is $1033 per credit hour
for year 2019–2020.
All of the graduate courses in our programs are 3 credit hours per term.
Hence the fee per course through summer 2019 is $3099.
The tuition fees for the entire Master’s program,
which has a 10-course requirement, is $30990, plus any incremental
increases in tuition for courses taken in later academic years.
